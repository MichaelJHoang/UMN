Problem 1: heat_mpi
===================

heat_mpi Timing Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Fill in the following table on measuring the performance of your
  `heat_mpi' program on MSI's Mesabi machine. Replace 00.00 entries with
  your actual run times. You can use the provided `heat-slurm.sh' script
  to ease this task. Submit it using `sbatch heat-slurm.sh' and extract
  the lines marked `runtime:'.

heat_mpi Discussion Questions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Analyze your table of results and answer the following questions.
  1. Did using more processors result in speedups?
  2. Describe any trends or anomalies you see in the timings and
     speculate on their causes - e.g. was there are a steady increase in
     runtimes, steady decrease, or jagged changes in timing?
  3. Try to explain how number of processors and problem size seem to
     affect runtimes/speedup in the problem. Consider that most Mesabi
     Nodes have 24 cores on them. Comment on whether this number seems
     to affect the performance of the runs you see.


Problem 2: kmeans_serial vs kmeans_mpi
======================================

  Discuss how you chose to parallelize your serial version of K-means in
  the program `kmeans_mpi.c'. Answer the following questions briefly.
  1. How is the input and output data partitioned among the processors?
  2. What communication is required throughout the algorithm?
  3. Which MPI collective communication operations did you employ?


Problem 3: kmeans_mpi
=====================

kmeans_mpi Timing Table
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Fill in the following table on measuring the performance of your
  `kmeans_mpi' program on MSI's Mesabi machine. Replace 00.00 entries
  with your actual run times. You can use the provided `kmeans-slurm.sh'
  script to ease this task.

  The columns are for each of 3 data files that are provided and run in
  the job script.
