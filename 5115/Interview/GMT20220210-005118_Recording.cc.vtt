00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.000
Alright so I'm gonna start the recording right now and try to answer it as much as you can. Right. Uh huh.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
But, yeah, I'm going to start so.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Do you have any roommates.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Yes, I do. I have two other roommates.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Two other roommates. Okay. And how is cooking partition between you guys.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Usually I cook.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:34.000
The male roommate that I have he cooks from time to time but usually we don't really eat his food, and I'm the main one to eat like cook.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So what did they usually cook for the guy he usually cooks. Very, in my opinion, very fatty food, more Americanized food he does try in different cuisine like Asian food but usually doesn't taste the same for female roommate that I have, she likes to

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:06.000
bake more often. And for me, I usually make a whole wide range of things but usually stick to more Asian Vietnamese cuisine.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And are there any difficulties with keeping track of food within your roommates.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Yes, there is,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:31.000
for instance, there's difficulty in tracking, who bought What if they can eat this with that, as well as if we have certain ingredients.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So, our thought our food do you think it will be more likely to eat it if you were aware that it is sitting in your fridge.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Why, why not.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Um, we would eat it if we were aware, a lot of times, usually we are aware of what's in there but sometimes we forget what's in the fridge.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Okay.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Like, can you give me some examples.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Like, I would make portions enough to last as the whole week. So that would mean that we have a lot of leftovers in the fridge and until we put those in containers and usually they get pushed back into the fridge.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And as we keep going throughout the weeks and months. It may sit back there.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
If we don't remember it, or if we don't crave it but another time.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Okay, and that said.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Other like lots of expire food without mind from time to time, food does expire and sometimes they to kind of get moldy, and it's kind of a shame because we have to throw it away.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
like, Can you put it into like an amount.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000
I would say

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
about once a month we do have to throw something away like one or two containers

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
containers, like how large are these containers.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Kinda like the Chinese takeout containers, where they put liquids in it.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Oh, I see, I see.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:21.000
So I'm guessing that like you don't know that they've expired until

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:34.000
months later, right, not months just like a couple of weeks, usually a female roommate does take the consideration of what's in the fridge. I often forget what we have.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:48.000
But sup from time to time she asked me if this is still okay and then I kind of breeze over it and say, Yes, okay. and they see you know the next day, it goes kind of moldy or sour.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:04:00.000
All right. And what's the food leftovers situation like that. Sure home when you're with family, with family so away from my house or.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Yeah, with an apartment.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Yeah, so the food and leftovers.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.000
With away from my house, usually is.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I don't know standard in my eyes because my parents, they, they freeze a lot of things so they don't go bad and leftovers are just defrost and microwave it up.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:38.000
So, I think they have like a better standpoint, on not letting food rot, whereas in my apartment we don't really have the amount of space to do that kind of routine.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I see.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Okay, like to explain more about this feeling.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:07.000
So, for me since I grew up kind of poor and scares and growing up, it was like we don't waste food, and we should eat all the food that we have and make sure it doesn't go bad.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So to me, it kind of feels like a gut punch that it's like dang I wasted food. This isn't right. We don't have the money to get more ingredients and we should have been busy instead of eating something else or possibly even ordering takeout.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
All right, so

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.000
I see the world experiences with eating expired food.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Well, my experiences are food poisoning.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Feelings of regret, but also

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
feeling sick sometimes.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Okay, so you said that you got sick, right from eating expert food. So, how did that situation affect you.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Be kind of made me want to eat all the food first before getting new things because I don't want to waste food again. And that was right.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.000
I get that right but like how's it being sick from eating food affect you.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:37.000
affected me because it may be unable to function normally, because I was too busy being in the bathroom, or just feeling under the water to do my daily routines

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000
are what's the oldest item that you have had in your refrigerator.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Well, you know i I think it was.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I think it was a beer or each thing.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.000
This could be something like in the past, or right now that's in your fridge, by the way. Okay, yeah.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:27.000
My mom gave me a bunch of oranges, but she keeps doing that, and a while back ago I was kind of bored I left one orange to stay there to see if the fridge was the issue with the spoiling everything, and the orange kind of molded over and like became hard

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
and mushy.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:38.000
So I would say about like two months that was in there for,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000
do you organize your fridge to the best of our ability. Yes.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So okay so how do you organize the food in your fridge.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:08:02.000
So we tried various different ways, the way of organization that we have written now is that we have takeout and leftovers. On the bottom bracket the fridge.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:12.000
In the bins where you put fruits and veggies we actually put condiments instead. Because we don't use those as often and we don't see them from like an eye view.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:20.000
When we open the fridge so it's more or less likely to get spoiled because kind of resource well that easily.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
And then we put fruits and veggies on the top rack, where it's closest to like the vent and everything.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:37.000
And in the middle rack we put stuff like juice, and drinks and eggs if we have them.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:52.000
How. Oh god. Oh yeah. And then on the door we do put extra economists are things that don't go bad as well.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.000
How often do you find a expiring food.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Before I found expand to every other week or so now that we implemented this sort of structure.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:19.000
I would say that we don't find that as much however,

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:29.000
let's say, in a month we've only had to throw a food twice.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
What's the most common food that you usually throw out.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000
It's usually fruits, because they tend to expire faster in our fridge.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Any specific fruits or this fruits, in general,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:57.000
I would say, apples, and one point we had like grapes so I would say, fruits, with a lot of moisture content inside.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000
With basically high water content. Yeah, There we go.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Okay, so.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Okay.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:17.000
So how do you how do your values impact your decisions when you go grocery shopping, my values in what way.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Like do you look to buy local produce or organic foods or Oh yeah, so I like to shop for groceries at least like fresh groceries at markets, particularly like farmers markets but since there's not that many here I go to more produce shops that are not

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.000
huge companies such as Walmart and everything so we have a fresh belly mark here and I buy produce from there.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:11:12.000
And I guess like my values, kind of like, get in the way of their because they. We do use the food, but I feel worse about when it spoils because it was actual fresh food that we made with the food that we bought.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:28.000
But we also do go to like the food pantry and stuff to which we don't feel 100% bad if it goes bad, but there's still the feeling of regret and such.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Why, why is that so because its food and when spoiled when we could have not had it spoil.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Now, tell me about a time when you decide to go grocery shopping and how much or what you buy each time.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Um, so we do grow grocery shopping, every one or two weeks.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:19.000
At one time, we don't buy that much. Actually we buy about a handful, or not begs for three people to bring in, but typically we buy me and some other ingredients to make something with that.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I'm like, what kinds of meat.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Usually we go for the cheapest cans of meat because we're trying to save money on cheapest.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Do you know what kind of cuts. Usually for, we get chicken.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000
The darker meat so like dies and wings and stuff, and sometimes breast for certain things that we're making.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:55.000
I don't particularly buy beef, because in. For me it's not my preference I don't typically like to eat beef.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:02.000
And we buy a lot of fish, actually, and seafood products.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000
And I'm.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:21.000
What kind of fish or seafood. Such fish such as tuna filets, and then a salmon Falaise to, or they call it tuna steaks, I think. And then we also get

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:37.000
whole fish from like the market as well. And I just got in clean it up and just fried upper pig.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000
So doesn't matter to you whether or not. Food is organic.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Yeah, I typically like it to be organic. However, with the means that I am in under right now I don't afford it all the time. But when I do buy organic I try to make it less and try not to make a slow because it costs more.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
So that said, what sorts of dishes do you make again.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:25.000
I typically like to cook more agent South foods, because that reminds me of home and what I ate as a kid growing up, so I cook more Vietnamese food, but also do some Chinese food, as well since that was also what we were growing up with, like, what part

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000
like, do you know what, I'm region the Chinese food is coming from inspired from.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I'm not sure 100% it's what my mom takes it from IC.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.000
And that said, um, do you plan your meals, like do you cook them.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
And like Panama for like the next 10 days for example.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Uh, no, not in particular I just wake up one day and figure hey I want to cook this, and then call up my mom and ask if she has any recipes for that.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Or just wing it. But with that food it just lasted for a while, however many times that make it because I make large portion sizes to last us for the whole week, even though pretty much you cook fresh and you don't you don't plan, as long as there's like

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:42.000
leftovers right. That's going to be the meal for the day. Yeah, and for, and with however much leftovers we have, that's the meal for X amount of more days.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Okay.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:55.000
Is there been a time where you want to cook something but you didn't know if you had to gradients or not give up 10 again.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Has there ever been a time where you want to cook something, but didn't know whether or not you had the ingredients. Oh yeah, a multitude of times, I mean, even right now my roommates went out to buy some ingredients because the guy wanted to make some

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000
fried rice so they're going to get ingredients right now.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:23.000
I see, and the US separately recipes when you cook dishes.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:45.000
For me, I typically don't use set recipes, I do it from memory or taste. And for my roommates, they typically like to use set recipes because they don't cook as often as I do.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Do you cook dishes. Oh, do you cook dishes often or do you repeat them often.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Like, as in you cook the same thing, like for the entire month for example or do like mix it up. Oh no I'm, mix it up. If we cook different time month I'd probably go crazy.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:21.000
All right, I see So, do you have any anything to change or added to any of the answers to the previous questions. I don't think so. I'm

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:38.000
for the one nutritional value in our food, I do pay a lot of attention to that because I have food insecurity, but kind of state we're in, I'm just trying to make do with what we have and what we can get.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
That makes sense.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
So any other final thoughts.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Uh, I think that is all right so I'd like to thank you for your time, just letting you know
