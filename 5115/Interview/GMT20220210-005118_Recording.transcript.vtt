00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.130
Jon-Michael Hoang: Do you have any roommates.

2
00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.980
Jay: Yes, I do, I have two other roommates.

3
00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.790
Jon-Michael Hoang: Do other roommates Okay, and how is cooking partition between you guys.

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.859
Jay: Usually I cook.

5
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:28.080
Jay: The male roommate that I have he cooks from time to time, but usually we don't really eat his food and i'm, the main one to eat like cook.

6
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.990
Jon-Michael Hoang: So what do they.

7
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.880
Jon-Michael Hoang: Usually cook.

8
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:48.480
Jay: For the guy he usually cooks very, in my opinion, very fatty food more americanized food he does try in different cuisine like Asian food, but.

9
00:00:48.960 --> 00:01:02.220
Jay: Usually doesn't taste the same for female roommate and I have she likes to bake more often and, for me, I usually make a whole wide range of things, but usually stick to more Asian Vietnamese cuisine.

10
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:11.250
Jon-Michael Hoang: And, are there any difficulties with keeping track of food within your roommates.

11
00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.590
Jay: Yes, there is.

12
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:24.840
Jay: For instance, there's difficulty in tracking who bought What if they can eat this or that, as well as if we have certain ingredients.

13
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:38.520
Jon-Michael Hoang: So our leftover food, do you think it will be more likely to eat it if you were aware that it is sitting in your fridge why, why not.

14
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.950
Jay: um.

15
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.650
Jay: We would eat it if we were aware, a lot of times usually, we are aware of what's in there, but sometimes you forget what's in the fridge.

16
00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.710
Jon-Michael Hoang: Okay.

17
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.100
Jon-Michael Hoang: Like can you give me some examples.

18
00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:16.980
Jay: Like I wouldn't make portions enough to last as the whole week so that would mean that we have a lot of leftovers in the fridge and so we put those containers and usually push back into the fridge and as we keep going throughout the weeks and months, it may sit back there.

19
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.960
Jay: If we don't remember it or if we don't crave it and another time.

20
00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.800
Jon-Michael Hoang: Okay, and that said.

21
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.550
Jon-Michael Hoang: Are there like lots of expire food with that in mind.

22
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:39.480
Jay: From time to time food does expire, and sometimes they to kind of get moldy and it's kind of a shame, because we have to throw it away.

23
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.320
Jon-Michael Hoang: Like can you put it into like an amount.

24
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.430
Jay: uh I would say.

25
00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.570
Jay: About once a month, we do have to throw something away like one or two containers.

26
00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.490
Jon-Michael Hoang: Containers like how large are these containers.

27
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.620
Jay: kind of like the Chinese takeout containers where they put liquids in it.

28
00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.100
Jon-Michael Hoang: Oh, I see I see.

29
00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.550
Jon-Michael Hoang: So i'm guessing that like you don't know that they've expired until.

30
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.900
Jon-Michael Hoang: months later right.

31
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.170
Jay: Not months, just like a couple weeks usually.

32
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:45.210
Jay: A female roommate does take the consideration of what's in the fridge I often forget what we have, but it's up from time to time she asked me if this is still okay and and kind of breeze over it, and say yes Okay, and I see now the next day it goes kind of moldy or sour.

33
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:54.060
Jon-Michael Hoang: All right, and what's the food left over a situation like that sure home when you're with family.

34
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.530
Jay: Family so away from my house or.

35
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.510
Jon-Michael Hoang: yeah with an apartment.

36
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:08.550
Jay: yeah so the food and leftovers with away from my house usually is.

37
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:24.510
Jay: I don't know standard in my eyes, because my parents, they they freeze a lot of things, so they don't go bad and leftovers are just defrost and microwave it up, so I think they have like a better.

38
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:33.810
Jay: standpoint on not letting food right, whereas in my apartment we don't really had them amount of space to do that kind of routine.

39
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.260
Jon-Michael Hoang: I see so when you waste food like, how do you feel.

40
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.460
Terrible.

41
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.300
Jon-Michael Hoang: Okay, like do you explain more about this feeling.

42
00:04:52.530 --> 00:05:06.510
Jay: So for me since I grew up kind of poor and scares and growing up, it was like we don't waste food, and we should eat all the food that we have and make sure it doesn't go bad.

43
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:21.960
Jay: So, to me it kind of feels like it got punched that it's this like dang I wasted food this isn't right we don't have the money to get more ingredients and we should have been this instead of eating something else, or possibly even ordering takeout.

44
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.240
Jon-Michael Hoang: Alright, so.

45
00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.620
Jon-Michael Hoang: I see the word experiences with eating expired food.

46
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.620
Jay: Well, my experiences are food poisoning.

47
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.760
Jay: feelings of regret, but also.

48
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.510
Jay: feeling sick sometimes.

49
00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.640
Jon-Michael Hoang: Okay, so you said that you got sick right from eating expert food so.

50
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.270
Jon-Michael Hoang: How did that situation affect you.

51
00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:07.500
Jay: It kind of made me want to eat all the food first, before getting new things, because I don't want to waste food again.

52
00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:08.850
Jon-Michael Hoang: And that was right, I.

53
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.820
Jon-Michael Hoang: get it right, but like how's it.

54
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.420
Jon-Michael Hoang: Being sick from eating expired food effect you.

55
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:27.450
Jay: Affected me because it may be unable to function normally because I was too busy being in the bathroom or just feeling under the water to do my daily routines.

56
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.280
Jon-Michael Hoang: Are what's the oldest item that you have had in your refrigerator.

57
00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:45.390
Jay: well.

58
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.470
Jay: You know I, I think it was.

59
00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:54.090
Jay: I think it was.

60
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.430
Jon-Michael Hoang: thing.

61
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.550
Jon-Michael Hoang: And this could be something like in the past or right now that's in your fridge, by the way.

62
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:27.180
Jay: Oh okay yeah my mom gave me a bunch of oranges, but and she keeps doing that and a while back ago I was just kind of bored I left one orange to stay there to see if the fridge was the issue with the spoiling everything and that orange kind of molded over and like became hard and mushy.

63
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.480
Jay: So I would say about like two months, those in there for.

64
00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:38.940
Jon-Michael Hoang: Do you organize your fridge.

65
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.990
Jay: To the best of our ability, yes.

66
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:47.760
Jon-Michael Hoang: So okay So how do you organize the food in your fridge.

67
00:07:49.230 --> 00:08:01.410
Jay: So we tried various different ways the way of organization that we have right now is that we have take out and leftovers on the bottom rack of the fridge.

68
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:13.830
Jay: In the bins where you put fruits and veggies we actually put condiments instead because we don't use us as often and we don't see them from like an eye view when we open the fridge so it's.

69
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:32.280
Jay: More or less likely to get spoiled because kind of resource well that easily, and then we put fruits and veggies on the top rack where it's closest to like the Van and everything and in the middle wreck we put stuff like juice and drinks and eggs if we have them.

70
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:37.650
Jon-Michael Hoang: yeah how.

71
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:38.490
Jon-Michael Hoang: Oh God.

72
00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:44.880
Jay: Oh yeah and then on the door we do put extra economists are things that don't go bad as well.

73
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:54.990
Jon-Michael Hoang: And how often do you find are expiring food.

74
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:04.740
Jay: Before I found expanding food every other week or so now that we implemented this sort of.

75
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:06.990
Jay: structure.

76
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.860
Jay: I would say that we don't find it as much, however.

77
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:16.920
Jay: um.

78
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.790
Jay: I would say in a month we've only had to throw a food twice.

79
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.380
Jon-Michael Hoang: hey what's the most common food that you usually throw out.

80
00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:37.920
Jay: it's usually fruits, because they tend to expire faster in our fridge.

81
00:09:39.330 --> 00:09:42.810
Jon-Michael Hoang: any specific fruits, or is this fruits in general.

82
00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:54.210
Jay: um I would say, apples and at one point, we had like grapes, so I would say fruits, with a lot of moisture content inside.

83
00:09:56.130 --> 00:09:57.870
Jon-Michael Hoang: With basically high water content.

84
00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.950
Jay: yeah there we go.

85
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:03.630
Jon-Michael Hoang: Okay, so.

86
00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:12.450
Jon-Michael Hoang: Okay So how do you how do your values impact your decisions when you go grocery shopping.

87
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.240
Jay: My values in what way.

88
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:22.260
Jon-Michael Hoang: Like do you look to buy local produce or organic foods or.

89
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:22.890
Jay: Oh yeah.

90
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.050
Jay: So I like to shop.

91
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:37.320
Jay: For groceries at least like fresh groceries at markets, particularly like farmers markets, but since there's not that many here I go to more produce shops that are.

92
00:10:39.510 --> 00:10:45.810
Jay: Huge companies such as walmart and everything, so we have a fresh belly Mart here and I buy products from there.

93
00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:50.370
Jay: And I guess like my values kind of like.

94
00:10:51.600 --> 00:11:03.030
Jay: getting away with that because they we do use the food, but I feel worse about when it spoils because it was actual fresh food that we made with the food that we bought.

95
00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:24.960
Jay: Oh, but we also do go to like the food pantry and stuff to which we don't feel 100% bad if it goes bad, but there's still the feeling of regret and such.

96
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:29.640
Jon-Michael Hoang: And why was that so.

97
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:35.580
Jay: Because its food and when spoiled when we could have not had it spoil.

98
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:50.160
Jon-Michael Hoang: Now tell me about a time when you decide to go grocery shopping and how much or what you buy each time.

99
00:11:51.690 --> 00:12:02.430
Jay: um so we do grow grocery shopping every one or two weeks at one time we don't buy that much actually we buy.

100
00:12:04.290 --> 00:12:10.980
Jay: About a handful or not begs for three people to bring in but typically we buy.

101
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:16.050
Jay: me and some other ingredients to make something with that.

102
00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.840
Jon-Michael Hoang: i'm like what kinds of meat.

103
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:31.740
Jay: Usually, we go for the cheapest cans of meat, because we're trying to save money, Nice.

104
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:32.940
Jon-Michael Hoang: Cheap is already know that.

105
00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:34.830
Jon-Michael Hoang: You know what kind of cuts.

106
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:44.640
Jay: easily, for we get chicken the darker meats so like dies and wings and stuff and sometimes press for certain things that we're making.

107
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:59.010
Jay: I don't particularly buy beef, because in for me it's not my preference I don't typically like to eat beef and we buy a lot of fish actually and see food products.

108
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:02.820
Jon-Michael Hoang: And um.

109
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.160
Jon-Michael Hoang: What kind of fish or seafood.

110
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:18.210
Jay: Such fish, such as tuna fil a's and then salmon place to or they call it tuna states, I think, and then we also get.

111
00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:27.420
Jay: Whole fish from like the market as well, and I just got in clean it up and just fry it up or bake.

112
00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:40.050
Jon-Michael Hoang: So it doesn't matter to you, whether or not food is organic.

113
00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:56.940
Jay: yeah I typically like it to be organic, however, with the means that I am in under it now I don't afford it all the time, but when I do buy organic or you try to make it last and try not to make a split because it costs more.

114
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:04.680
Jon-Michael Hoang: So that said oh what sorts of dishes do you make again.

115
00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:21.570
Jay: I typically like to cook more agents out of foods, because that reminds me of home and what I ate as a kid growing up, so I cook more Vietnamese food, but I also do some Chinese food as well, since that was also what we were growing up with.

116
00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:28.680
Jon-Michael Hoang: Like what part like Dino what i'm region, the Chinese food is coming from.

117
00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:30.450
Jon-Michael Hoang: Inspired from.

118
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:31.860
um.

119
00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:38.220
Jay: i'm not sure 100% it's what my mom takes it from.

120
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.560
Jon-Michael Hoang: I see.

121
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:48.120
Jon-Michael Hoang: And that's it um do you plan your meals like do you cook them.

122
00:14:49.650 --> 00:14:52.470
Jon-Michael Hoang: And like Panama for like the next 10 days, for example.

123
00:14:53.520 --> 00:15:04.110
Jay: uh no not in particular I just wake up one day and figure hey I want to cook this and then call it my mom and asked if she has any recipes for that.

124
00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:15.900
Jay: or just hoping it but with that food it just last us for a while, however many times that make it because I make large portion sizes to last us for the whole week even.

125
00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:20.550
Jon-Michael Hoang: Though pretty much you cook fresh you don't.

126
00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:27.030
Jon-Michael Hoang: You don't plan as long as there's like leftovers right that's going to be the meal for the day.

127
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:34.710
Jay: yeah and for how much leftovers, we have that's the meal for X amount of more days.

128
00:15:45.690 --> 00:15:51.060
Jon-Michael Hoang: Has there been a time where you want to cook something, but you didn't know if you had the gradients or not.

129
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:53.880
Jay: you'd be panicking.

130
00:15:54.930 --> 00:16:01.410
Jon-Michael Hoang: Has there ever been a time where you want to cook something but didn't know whether or not you had the ingredients.

131
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:13.950
Jay: Oh yeah a multitude of times I mean even right now my roommates went out to buy some ingredients, because the guy wanted to make some fried rice so they're going to get ingredients right now.

132
00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:20.340
Jon-Michael Hoang: I see and they use set recipes when you cook delicious.

133
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:35.220
Jay: For me, I typically don't use that recipes I do it from memory or taste and for my roommates they typically like to use set recipes because they don't cook as often as I do.

134
00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:49.860
Jon-Michael Hoang: He do you cook dishes Oh, do you cook dishes often or do you repeat them, often.

135
00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:59.310
Jon-Michael Hoang: Like as in do you cook the same thing, like for an entire month, for example, or do you like mix it up.

136
00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:04.260
Jay: Oh no i'm mix it up if we could do it for an entire month i'd probably go crazy.

137
00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:12.720
Jon-Michael Hoang: All right, I see So do you have any anything to change or add to any of the answers to the previous questions.

138
00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:18.060
Jay: I don't think so um.

139
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:28.260
Jay: For the one nutritional value in our food I do pay a lot of attention to that because I have food insecurity, but.

140
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:35.670
Jay: kind of state we're in i'm just trying to make do with what we have and what we can get.

141
00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:38.430
Jay: That makes sense.
