**Class Notes**

- bp base pairs
- HMM examples
- query on y axis, reference on x
    - insert when going down
    - deleter when going right
- C = n*l / L
    - [C]overage
    - n == number of reads
    - l == length of each read
    - L == length of the genomic element
- Bridge obsession prob
    - > 2 odd degree nodes, cannot cross every edge once

- Euler Theorem
    - A graph is balanced if for every vert the num of incodes equals to the num of outcodes
        - in(v) == out(v)
- If it's balanced, how do we prove it's Eulerian?
    - DFS

- Hamiltonian Cycle Problem
    - Find a cycle that visits every vertex exactly one
    - NP-C
