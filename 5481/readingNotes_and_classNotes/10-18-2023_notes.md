**Class Notes**

- Overlap-Layout-Consensus:
    - got a bunch of reads, find where they overlap

- Finding overlaps w/ dynamic programming
    - Find the best alignment of a suffix X to a prefix Y
    - We'll use gloval alignment recurrence and score function
    - But how do we force it to find prefix/suffix matches?
        - X gap penalties are 0
        - First part of Y gap penalties are infinity

-Challenges in fragment assembly
    - **repeats**
        - >50% of the human genome are repeats:
            - over 1m Alu repeats
        - repeat types:
            - low complexity dna
            - micro satellite repeats
            - transposons/retrotransposons
                - SINE
                - LINE
                - LTR retroposons
        - gene families
        - segmental dupes

- Layout
    - redundant edges
        - remove transitively-inferrible edges, starting with edges that skip one node or two nodes
