**Class Notes**

**Next-Gen Sequencing Methods and Applications**

- Major NGS tech: Illumina, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore
- Emerging: Element, Ultima

- NGS applications:
    - sequencing
    - targeted sequencing
    - gene expression
    - epigenetics
    - single cell seq.

- cost of sequencing outpacing Moore's Law

- Sanger sequencing
    - modern techniques use Capillary Electrophoresis

**Sequencing a Genome (w/ short and long reads)**

- Ordered Assembly
- Shotgun Assembly
    - Craig Venter
    - Closed genomes --> break up all of them --> Assembly

- Illumina
    - Genomic DNA --> Fragmented DNA --> Sequencing Library
    - Anatomy
        - Flow cell adapter
        - Read 1 sequencing primer
        - DNA insert (to be sequenced)
        - Read 2 sequencing primer
        - Flow cell adapter

- N50: A Measure of Assembly Contiguity
    -Definition: 50% of the genome is in contigs larger than N50
    - Example: 1Mb genome
    - Contigs: [300][100][50][40][40] <-- 50% (N50 - 40kb)

- Long Read Tech: PacBio Sequencing
    - Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) Sequencing
    - Zero Mode Waveguide (ZMW)
    - Nanopore Sequencing
    - ConcatMap -- Mapping Long Reads to a Circular Reference

- Tradeoffs
    - Illumina: Very short, but very cheap
    - PacBio: High read length
    - Oxford Nanopore

- PacBio Onso -- Sequencing by Binding (SBB)
