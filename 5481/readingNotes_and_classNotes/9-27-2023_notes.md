**Class Notes**

- Jacaard index in a nutshell:
    - intersection divided by union (total)

**Gap penalty models**
- in bio, gaps are counted by groups (i.e. ________ is 1 gap, and not however many underscores)
- in practice, single long gaps are more common
    - linear/affine gap
        - recheck slides for the models
            - convex model
            - arbitrary model
- reverse complement
    - where the query can be reversed (due to how helixes work)
    - TTCC could match TTCC or GGAA
        - how to address this?
            - just try both
        - how much longer?
            - 2x
- translated search from DNA query to AA reference
    - just shift where you start (frame shifting)
    - takes 6x longer
        - might need to reverse the query as well

**Multiple alignment**
- can reveal subtle similarities that pairwise alignments don't reveal
- phylogenetic tree
- aligning 3 seq.
    - cube structure
    - similar to NM alg.
        - check from 7 outcodes instead of 3
    - sum of pairs
        - AvB, AvC, BvC ==> scores of the three summed
- greedy method
    - try all pairs and with the remainder, try to align and so forth
