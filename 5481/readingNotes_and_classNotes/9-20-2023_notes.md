**Class Notes**

- Global: When aligning 2 AA from the same protein
- Semi-global: When searching short DNA reads against a DB
-Local: When searching for a novel AA sequence against a DB
    - might be interested if *part* of the protein matches really well
- Reference seq on top, Query on bottom
- DNA( _ _ _ ) --> AA( _ )
    - removing 1 or 2 DNA base frame shifts
    - 3 puts it back in frame
- Exhaustive search bad
- "X-drop" method is not always optimal as it prunes any positions that falls more than X below the current score (along the anti-diagonal)
- BURST (2017)
- Bowtie2, a human-genome search tool, is a very popular heuristic/approx. method

- BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool)
    - finds a good match, but not guaranteed optimal
    - find a subset of db seq. that have short exact matches in common with the query ("seeds")
    - extended the alignment from those exact matches using S-W
    - report the best-scoring alignments
    - has an ***e*** value that tells you how sig. a match is
        - given the length of the query
        - and overall size of your database
