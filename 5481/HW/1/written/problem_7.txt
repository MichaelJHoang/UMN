The largest discrepancy in amino acid counts between the coding sequences and 
the whole genome sequences is the last column with the [Stp] codes wherein
there's 774 in the whole genome counter to the other's 12. The [possible] reason for this 
is because the whole genome contains ***multiple*** open reading frames with its stop codons, 5' and 3' UTRs,
and signal peptides -- all of which can be of varying length. This leads to the `count_codons.py` code 
to produce a massive amount of [stp] codes because there's no frame shifting or separation to account 
for them. With proper separation and frame shifts, as seen in the separate_genes file, we are able to 
get a more accurate reading of the genome and therefore, fewer [stp] code readings.
