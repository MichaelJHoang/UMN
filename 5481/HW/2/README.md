This submission is for CSCI 5481's HW1 -- code authored by J.Michael Hoang, questions answered by J.Michael Hoang with sources hyperlinked.

- To run the main code (aligner.py):
    - Simply follow the command line highlighted under the second page of the write up, under "Input and Output Format"
    
- To run the auxillary code (aminoacid_translator.py):
    - Run:
    ```
    python3 aminoacid_translator.py -q [query fasta file] -r [reference fasta file] -qo [query amino acid output file name] -ro [reference amino acid output file name]
    ```
    - **NOTE:**
        - The translator code converts the stop codon into an asterisk (*), so if you're the TA for CSCI 5481, please replace said asterisk with an **O** so that the autograder doesn't fuck me over.

- Other than that, input files are in the [**input**] folder, output in [**output**], written answers for questions [4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11] are in the [**written**] folder.

- pls contact me should any question(s) arise.
